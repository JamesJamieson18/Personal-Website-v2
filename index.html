                    <!-- <h3 class="aboutMe aboutMe-body">I first started my software journey in 2016 when I would modify a game called Minecraft by injecting open-source Java packets to change the game mechanics and add custom items. From there I built my own multiplayer server so that my friends and I could play together. Originally I used an old PC and Ubuntu desktop but later I learned command line and switched to Ubuntu Server to better optimize the old PCs computing resources.</h3><br> -->

                    <h3 class="aboutMe aboutMe-body">Studied at Bethel School of Technology and William Jessup University for Full-Stack Development and received a certification on Software Development. Since then I’ve built multiple programs including <a href="https://github.com/JamesJamieson18/Personal-Website-v2">this website</a> and an impressive <a href="https://github.com/JamesJamieson18/team-double-trouble-backend">backend API</a> with custom authentication for a Twitter derivative my classmate and I built. I’ve also done contract work for company's like SUM Bible College.</h3>

                    <h3 class="aboutMe aboutMe-body">I have been playing with computers my whole life, at the age of 14 I built my first computer and since then I love finding old tech that would normanly be thrown out and finding a new purpose for it. As of this year I decided to make my knowledge offical and am working on receiving a certification from Arduino on my knowledge of Electronics, Programming and Physical Computing.</h3><br>

                    <h3 class="aboutMe aboutMe-body aboutMe-end">I started to learn mechanical design by playing with Lego Technics and building R/C cars. From there I moved on to real cars, rebuilding my first engine at 18 and getting a job with Subaru as a mechanic. Now I design my own creations with AutoCAD and bring them into reality with my 3D printer that I built myself. </h3><br>
